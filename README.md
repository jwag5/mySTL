About:  This project is essentially my version of the c++ Standard Template Library. Yes, I know there is alrady an STL, and I, or anybody really, should use already made, concise, and perfected code on any project of merit. However, I HIGHLY recommend to any aspiring programmer(such as I currently am as I write this) to write your own template library and try implementing all of the classes already in the STL. This is great practice for both coding, creating "reusable" code, and using a professional style. Plus, it REALLY helps you get to know the STL, which you will be using a lot of in the future!
